Layout
======

### Jade layout files

By convention, layout files are post fixed with `-layout`. The default layout for any app should be in the `/page` folder and simply be called `layout.jade`.

The Jade page template will have to be re-compiled in order to pick up the layout change. Simply run `gulp jade:marko` to achieve this!
