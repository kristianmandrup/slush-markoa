Assets
------

The `/asset` folder should contain your *stylesheets* and *script* files that are global to all your applications.

### Styles

The `/styles` folder should contain the global stylesheets.

-	Stylus
-	SASS
-	CSS

We strongly recommend using Stylus.

### Scripts

The `/styles` folder should contain global scripts.

Please group scripts by category and make sure they are not duplicates of scripts found in other apps.

Note: Markoa uses [Babel.io](babeljs.io) to compile ES2015 and ES2016 syntax to ECMA script 5 (known as ES5).
