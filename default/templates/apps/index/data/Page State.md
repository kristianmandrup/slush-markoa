Page State (Data)
-----------------

Page state is controlled here. What `index.js` exports will be the local `data` object available to the page, in this case to the `index` page.

Add nested objects by adding a nested hierarchy of folders, each with an `index.js` file which includes folders at the levels directly under it.

### TODO

In the future, the state folder will be renamed to `data` to be in line with marko data reference semantics: ie. `$data.xyz`
